        "\n",
        "One of the most effective strategies to improve performance of your language model applications is to split your large data into smaller pieces. This is call splitting or chunking (we'll use these terms interchangeably). In the world of multi-modal, splitting also applies to images.\n",

But because I chose to split on sentences, there was an issue with small short sentences after a long one. You know? (like this last sentenence). They could change the meaning of a chunk, so I added a positional reward and clusters were more likely to form if they were sentences next to each other. This ended up being ok, but tuning the parameters was slow and unoptimal.\n",
        "2) **Find break points between sequential sentences** - Next up I tried a walk method. I started at the first sentence, got the embedding, then compared it to sentence #2, then compared #2 and #3 and so on. I was looking for \"break points\" where embedding distance was large. If it was above a threshold, then I considered it the start of a new semantic section. I originally tried taking embeddings of every sentence, but this turned out to be too noisy. So I ended up taking groups of 3 sentences (a window), then got an embedding, then dropped the first sentence, and added the next one. This worked out a bit better.\n",
